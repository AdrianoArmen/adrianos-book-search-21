## App Deployment on Heroku 📦

- [App Deploy Link](https://still-crag-44399.herokuapp.com/)

## Project Description 📋
This MERN stack application was designed to showcase my overall knowledge of React development and [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) deployment using  [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/es/cloud/atlas/register) to host our [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/). It uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/) for API handling. It has a Sign Up / Login interface that will allow and authenticate users giving the option to store a book selection on the database. The main function of the app is to display a book-themed search engine and results for the logged-in users.

## Run App Locally 💬

npm run start
```
